``makorel`` is made to make release of new versions of your packages easy.

== How does it works? ==

``makorel`` assumes that there is consistency in your releases. That means:
  - Releases follow the usual alphabetical order.
  - New release will keep the same ``descr`` and ``opam`` files than
    the latest previous one. You may want to edit these files after their 
    generation.
  - The ``url`` file is generated by:
    -- Replacing the version number of the last released version archive 
       url.
    -- Downloading the file at to generate ``checksum`` using ``md5sum``.

//NB: There must be (at least) a previous release available in the opam 
repo you are in.//

== How to install? ==

Using opam. You will need to add my personnal repo as source.
```
$opam repository add sagotch https://github.com/sagotch/opam-repo-dev.git

```
$opam update
$opam install makorel
```

== Usage ==

```makorel version [package_directory]```

If you are in the directory containing your package releases, just run 
``makorel`` with the version number you want to create.

If you are not, also give the path to this directory.

```
$ ls
foo.0.1.0 foo.0.1.1

$ makorel 0.2.0

$ ls
foo.0.1.0 foo.0.1.1 foo.0.2.0
```

```
$ ls /path/to/foo
foo.0.1.0 foo.0.1.1

$ makorel 0.2.0 /path/to/foo

$ ls /path/to/foo
foo.0.1.0 foo.0.1.1 foo.0.2.0
```
